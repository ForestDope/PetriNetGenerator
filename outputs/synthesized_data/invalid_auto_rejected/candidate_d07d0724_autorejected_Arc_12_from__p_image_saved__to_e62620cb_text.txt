In a photo editing application, the user starts in an idle state. They can load an image. Once an image is loaded, they have a choice: either apply a filter or crop the image. After either applying a filter or cropping, the user can then choose to save the edited image or discard the changes. If they choose to save, the image undergoes a saving process, and upon completion, the application returns to the idle state. If they discard changes, the application immediately returns to the idle state.
