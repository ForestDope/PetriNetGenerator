A smart display application starts at a 'Main Menu'. From here, the user can choose to 'Play Music' or 'View Photo Slideshow'. If 'Play Music' is chosen: music starts playing (state 'Music Playing'). While 'Music Playing', the user can 'Pause Music' or 'Stop Music'. If 'Pause Music' is selected, music enters a 'Music Paused' state. From 'Music Paused', the user can 'Resume Music' or 'Stop Music'. 'Stop Music' (from either 'Music Playing' or 'Music Paused') returns the application to the 'Main Menu'. If 'View Photo Slideshow' is chosen: the photo slideshow begins, entering 'Slideshow Active'. While 'Slideshow Active', the user can 'Next Photo', 'Previous Photo', or 'Return to Main Menu'. 'Return to Main Menu' from 'Slideshow Active' brings the application back to the 'Main Menu'.
