An image editing application starts at a 'Welcome' screen. From here, the user can either 'Load Image' or 'Exit'. If an image is loaded, the application enters an 'Editing' mode. In 'Editing' mode, the user can repeatedly 'Apply Filter' or 'Adjust Brightness' to the current image. Any of these operations return the user to the 'Editing' mode, allowing further modifications. From 'Editing' mode, the user can also 'Save Image'. After saving, the user can choose to 'Load New Image' (returning to 'Editing' mode with a new image) or 'Return to Welcome' screen. The application can be exited from the 'Welcome' screen or after an image has been saved.
