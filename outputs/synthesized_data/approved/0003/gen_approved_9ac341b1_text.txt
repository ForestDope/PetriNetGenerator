A user interacts with a digital photo gallery. They start at the 'Gallery Menu'. From the menu, they can select any 'Album' to view its contents. Once an album is selected, the system displays the 'Album View' with photo thumbnails. From 'Album View', the user can select a specific photo to enter 'Photo View' where the image is displayed full screen. While in 'Photo View', they can navigate to the 'Next Photo' or 'Previous Photo' within the current album. They can also 'Exit Photo View' to return to the 'Album View'. From the 'Album View', they have the option to 'Exit Album' and return to the 'Gallery Menu'. Finally, from the 'Gallery Menu', they can 'Exit Gallery' to end the session.
