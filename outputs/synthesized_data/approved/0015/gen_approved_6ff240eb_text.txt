A user interacts with an online photo gallery. From the 'Main Gallery View', they can 'Select a Photo' to view it in 'Full Screen'. While a photo is 'Full Screen', the system concurrently 'Pre-loads the Next Photo' in the background. The user can 'Zoom In' and 'Zoom Out' on the currently displayed photo. They can also 'Navigate to the Next Photo' in the sequence. If they navigate and it's the last photo, the gallery automatically 'Returns to the Main Gallery View'. At any point while viewing a photo, the user can explicitly 'Return to the Main Gallery View'.
