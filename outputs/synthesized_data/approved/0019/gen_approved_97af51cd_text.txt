A multimedia player starts at the main menu. From here, the user can choose to play a video or an audio track. If a video is selected, it begins playing in a normal window. While the video is playing in normal view, the user can pause it, and then resume it. The user can also enter full screen mode from either playing or paused normal view. Once in full screen mode, the video continues to play or remain paused. From full screen view, the user can pause/resume the video, or exit full screen mode, returning to its previous playing/paused state in normal view. If the video finishes playing normally (in either normal or full screen view), or if the user explicitly presses a 'Back to Menu' button (available from any video state: normal playing, normal paused, full screen playing, full screen paused), the player returns to the main menu. If an audio track is selected, it begins playing. While the audio is playing, the user can pause it, and then resume it. If the audio finishes playing normally, or if the user explicitly presses a 'Back to Menu' button (available from any audio state: playing, paused), the player returns to the main menu.
