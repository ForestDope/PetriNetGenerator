A user interacts with a multimedia player. The player starts in an idle state. From idle, the user can choose to either 'Play Audio' or 'Play Video'. If audio is playing, the user can 'Pause Audio' or 'Stop Audio'. If audio is paused, the user can 'Resume Audio' or 'Stop Audio'. If video is playing, the user can 'Pause Video' or 'Stop Video'. If video is paused, the user can 'Resume Video' or 'Stop Video'. In both the 'Audio Playing' and 'Video Playing' (and their respective paused) states, the user can concurrently 'Adjust Volume'. Stopping either audio or video returns the player to the idle state.
