An interactive storybook application allows users to navigate between a main menu, a story reading mode, and an image gallery mode. From the main menu, users can choose to 'Read Story' or 'View Gallery'. In 'Story Mode', users can navigate 'Next Page' or 'Previous Page'. Concurrently, they can 'Listen to Narration', which can be 'Paused', 'Resumed', or 'Stopped'. When the story reaches its last page, or the user manually chooses to 'Exit Story', they return to the main menu, and any active narration ceases. Similarly, in 'Gallery Mode', users can navigate 'Next Image' or 'Previous Image'. Concurrently, they can 'Play Background Music', which can also be 'Paused', 'Resumed', or 'Stopped'. When the user 'Exits Gallery', they return to the main menu, and any active music ceases. The application starts at the main menu.
