A user interacts with a video player. Initially, the player is idle. The user can load a video. Once loaded, the video automatically begins playing in standard quality. While playing, the user has several options: they can pause the video, resume it if paused, change the video quality between standard and high, or stop the video entirely. If the video is paused, it can be resumed or stopped. If the video finishes playing naturally, or is stopped by the user, the player enters a 'video ended/stopped' state. From this state, the user can unload the video to return to the idle state.
