A smart home display starts on the 'Home Screen'. From here, the user can choose to open the 'Music Player', the 'Photo Gallery', or the 'Settings' menu. If the 'Music Player' is active, music begins playing. The user can then 'Pause' the music (which can then be 'Resumed'), or 'Stop' it entirely, returning to the 'Home Screen'. If the 'Photo Gallery' is active, the user can navigate to the 'Next Photo' repeatedly or 'Exit Gallery' to return to the 'Home Screen'. If 'Settings' is open, the user can either 'Save Changes' or 'Discard Changes', both actions leading back to the 'Home Screen'.
