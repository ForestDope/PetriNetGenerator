A multimedia player starts at a Main Menu. From here, the user can choose to play an audio track or a video. If audio is chosen, it begins playing. While audio is playing, the user can pause it, resume it, stop it (returning to the Main Menu), or switch to video playback. If audio finishes normally, it also returns to the Main Menu. Similarly, if video is chosen, it begins playing. While video is playing, the user can pause it, resume it, stop it (returning to the Main Menu), or switch to audio playback. If video finishes normally, it also returns to the Main Menu. From any playing or paused state (audio or video), a 'Home' button can be pressed to immediately return to the Main Menu.
