The user interacts with an online art gallery. They start at the main gallery view, which displays a grid of artwork thumbnails. From this view, the user can either select a specific artwork to see its high-resolution details or navigate to an 'About Us' page. When an artwork is selected, its detailed view is presented at a default zoom level. While in the detailed artwork view, the user can 'Zoom In' to examine the image closer, and then 'Zoom Out' to return to the default view. From the detailed view (regardless of zoom level), the user can also 'Return to Gallery', 'View Next Artwork', or 'View Previous Artwork'. Viewing the next or previous artwork will load the new artwork's details and reset its zoom level to default. If the 'About Us' page is selected, it is displayed, and the user can 'Return to Gallery' from there. The system always begins at the main gallery view.
