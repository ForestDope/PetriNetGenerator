A user interacts with a smart media system. Initially, the system is idle. The user can power on the system, which brings them to the main menu for browsing content categories like movies, music, or photos. From the main menu, they can power off the system, returning it to idle. Once a content category is selected (e.g., 'Movies'), the user sees options for a specific content item (e.g., a movie title), such as 'Play' or 'View Info', or they can go back to the main menu. If 'Play' is chosen, the content begins playing. While playing, the user can 'Pause' the content, or 'Stop' it, which returns them to the main menu. If the content finishes playing naturally, it also returns to the main menu. From a paused state, the user can 'Resume' playback or 'Stop' it, again returning to the main menu. If 'View Info' is chosen, details about the content are displayed. From the info screen, the user can either start playing the content directly or exit back to the content options screen.
