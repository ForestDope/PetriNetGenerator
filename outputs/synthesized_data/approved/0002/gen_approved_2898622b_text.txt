A smart home media system starts in an 'Off' state. It can be turned 'On' to reach the 'Main Menu'. From the 'Main Menu', the user can choose to 'Play Music' or 'Play Video', or 'Turn Off' the system. When 'Music is Playing', it can be 'Paused', 'Stopped' (returning to Main Menu), or the track can be 'Skipped' (continuing to play). If 'Music is Paused', it can be 'Resumed' or 'Stopped'. Similarly, when 'Video is Playing', it can be 'Paused', 'Stopped' (returning to Main Menu), or 'Entered Full Screen'. If 'Video is Paused', it can be 'Resumed' or 'Stopped'. From 'Full Screen Video', the user can 'Exit Full Screen' (returning to Video Playing), 'Pause' the video, or 'Stop' the video. All 'Stop' actions (for both music and video, from any state including paused or full screen) lead back to the 'Main Menu'.
