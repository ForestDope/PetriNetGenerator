Embark on a virtual nature walk. You begin on a 'Forest Path'. From here, you can choose to explore 'Deeper Forest' or head to the 'Riverside'. If you choose 'Deeper Forest', you can then either 'Observe Wildlife' or 'Return to Forest Path'. While observing wildlife, you can optionally 'Take a Photo', which implies you are done observing and return to the 'Deeper Forest'. If you choose 'Riverside', you can 'Listen to Water Sounds' or 'Return to Forest Path'. While listening to water sounds, you can optionally 'Start Meditation', which, once finished, returns you to the 'Riverside' area. After observing wildlife or listening to water sounds (if you don't take a photo or meditate), you return to the respective area ('Deeper Forest' or 'Riverside'). You can end your nature walk from the 'Forest Path' at any time.
