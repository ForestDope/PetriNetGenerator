A user is viewing an electronics course online. They begin at the 'Title Slide'. From there, they must proceed to 'Slide 1: Introduction'. From 'Slide 1' or 'Slide 2: Basic Circuits', they can navigate to the 'Next' or 'Previous' slide (if available) or 'Quit Course'. 'Slide 3: Ohm's Law' is accessible from 'Slide 2'. On 'Slide 3', the user has a choice to either 'Watch Embedded Video' or 'Proceed to Quiz'. After the video finishes, the user returns to 'Slide 3'. Upon completing the quiz, the course is marked as 'Completed'. The course ends when the user 'Quits' from any active slide or successfully 'Completes' the quiz.
