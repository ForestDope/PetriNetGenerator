A user interacts with an online video player. Initially, the player is closed. The user can open the player, which brings them to a state where they can select a video from a list. Once a video is selected, it's ready to play, or the user can choose a different video. When playback starts, the video is playing in a normal view. From this state, the user can pause the video, stop it, or let it finish naturally. They can also switch to full-screen mode. If the video is paused in normal view, the user can resume playback or stop it. When in full-screen mode, whether playing or paused, the user can exit full-screen mode to return to the normal view. They can also pause/resume playback within full-screen, or stop the video. If a video finishes naturally in full-screen, it also ends. After a video finishes or is stopped, the user is presented with options to replay the same video, or return to the video selection menu. From the video selection menu, the user can also choose to close the player.
