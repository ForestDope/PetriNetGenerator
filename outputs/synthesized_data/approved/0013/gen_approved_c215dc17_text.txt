A user interacts with a photo gallery application. Upon launching, they are presented with the 'Main Gallery View'. From here, they can select an image to view it in 'Full-screen Image Viewing' mode. While viewing an image, they can navigate to the 'Next Image' or 'Previous Image' within the gallery, continuing in full-screen mode. They can also 'Exit Full-screen View' to return to the 'Main Gallery View'. Additionally, from 'Full-screen Image Viewing', the user can initiate a 'Sharing Process', which, once 'Completed Sharing', returns them to the full-screen view of the same image. From the 'Main Gallery View', the user can also 'Open Settings Menu'. Within 'Settings', they can either 'Save Settings' or 'Cancel Settings', both actions returning them to the 'Main Gallery View'. Finally, the user can 'Exit Application' from the 'Main Gallery View', ending the session.
