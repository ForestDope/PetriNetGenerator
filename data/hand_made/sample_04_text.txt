Load a playlist of audio tracks. Start playing the first track. While a track is playing, simultaneously try to fetch its album art from a server. The user can press 'Skip' to immediately stop the current track and start the next one. If a track finishes normally, also start the next track. If the user presses a global 'Stop' button while any track is playing, stop playback entirely and end the session. When the playlist is empty after a track finishes or is skipped, end the session.
