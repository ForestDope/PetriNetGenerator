Start the quiz by displaying the first question. The user submits an answer. Check if the answer is correct. If the answer is correct, acknowledge correctness and then load and display the next question. If the answer is incorrect, show a hint related to the question. After the user views the hint (e.g., clicks 'OK'), display the same question again for another attempt. The quiz finishes when the last question is answered correctly." (For simplicity, we'll model the loop for one question, implying it repeats)
